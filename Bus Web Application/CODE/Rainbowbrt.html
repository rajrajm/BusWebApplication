 <h1><i><u><center><font color="red">WHY BRT</font></center></u></i></h1><br>
 <p><center>The Rainbow BRTS is being developed in phases as the sustainable public transport
 option for Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. The Comprehensive Mobility Plans of both Pune 
 and Pimpri Chinchwad recommend the development of such systems. The rapid increase in
 vehicular traffic, increased congestion, expanded city limits and longer travel distances
 are some important trends in the twin cities. A high quality public transport is essential
 to avoid adverse impacts on the health of people and quality of life.Pune and Pimpri 
 Chinchwad Municipal Corporations recognise the need for creation of safe, affordable 
 and world class bus rapid transit infrastructure and services, with focus on commuter
 comfort and convenience, integration of modes and information technology. These would 
 help move towards a liveable and sustainable future</center></p>
